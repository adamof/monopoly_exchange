			    <p>You are missing that one sticker to win the prize, but you have two of the same type that you don't need? <strong>Don't worry!</strong></p>
			    <p>Using Monopoly Exchange you have <strong>two</strong> options:</p>
			    <ol>
			    	<li><strong>You can search for stickers</strong> - Again, using the checkboxes, select the stickers that you need. Then enter your e-mail in the field below and click "Search stickers". This will send a notification to all people who have the stickers that you need and so they will be able to contact you. What happens after that depends on you!</li>
			    	<li><strong>You can list your stickers</strong> - Using the checkboxes, select the stickers that you have, but don't need anymore. Then enter your e-mail in the field below and click "Add stickers". This will add your e-mail and your stickers to our databse, so whoever needs the stickers you have listed will receive your e-mail and contact you. What happens after that depends on you!</li>
			    </ol>
			    <p> We <strong>cannot</strong> guarantee that you will get the stickers you need, but at least we can try and match you with the person who has them! </p>
